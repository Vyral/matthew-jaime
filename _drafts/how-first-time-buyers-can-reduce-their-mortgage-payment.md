Most first-time homebuyers need to get pre-approved to understand what their monthly mortgage payment will be. That being said, we always encourage our buyers to get pre-approved through our in-house mortgage group: American Loan Corporation. ALC has been fortunate enough to partner with the city of Los Angeles to offer down payment assistance up to $90,000. This sum can reduce your monthly mortgage payment from $300 to $800 per month. If you’d like to know more about getting pre-approved or how ALC can help you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. To see my full message, watch this short video.
