Are you ready to soak up the dog days of summer with a night at the ballpark? We’re inviting you to join us on Saturday, August 10, at 6 p.m. to watch the hometown Los Angeles Dodgers take on the Arizona Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium. &nbsp;The tickets are on us, and you can enjoy all the free food and soft drinks you please. We wouldn’t be able to do what we do without you, and this is our way of saying thanks. As you know, for every one of our client events, we select a nonprofit to support. For this game, we’re supporting Legacy L.A., who work with underprivileged youth by providing programs to help them reach their full potential. So please bring a $20 gift card so we can all help Legacy L.A. give back to the community while we cheer on the Dodgers. We hope to see you there\!&nbsp;
