Once a buyer has been successfully pre-approved, their next step is to start submitting offers. When one of these offers is accepted, the buyer and seller will then sign what’s called a residential purchase agreement (or an RPA). An RPA is a contract that binds the buyer to the seller after their offer has been accepted. In our upcoming video series, we’ll dive deeper into the purpose this document holds in the real estate process. So be on the lookout for future updates from our team. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
