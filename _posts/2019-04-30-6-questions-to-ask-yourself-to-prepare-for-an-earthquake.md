Let’s face it—earthquake preparation is essential for homeowners in California. We have no clue when they’ll hit, but we can prepare ourselves to minimize the damage they’ll do.

With that in mind, here are six questions you need to ask yourself to know whether you’re as prepared as you can be:

**1\. Does your household know where to go to survive the initial jolt?** When an earthquake starts happening, is there a safe doorway everyone can stand under? Also, do your children know how to drop and take cover?

**2\. Do you have a survival kit with food, water, and first aid?** Will that last you long enough until your town gets back on its feet?

**3\. Do you have a gas wrench to turn off your gas?** If you’re a client of mine and you don’t have one of these, get in touch with me and I’d be happy to provide you with one.

**4\. Do you have warm clothes and blankets put away?** Remember, your home won’t have heat when the gas and power are out. 

**5\. Do you have flashlights and protection?** You don’t want to be stuck sitting in the dark, and you need to be able to defend your home and family if necessary. 

**6\. Do you need earthquake insurance as an extra layer of protection?** My answer to this is always “yes,” and I’d be happy to provide you with more information about it.

If you have any other questions about this or any other real estate topic, feel free to call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you.
